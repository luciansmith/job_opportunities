A small respository for posting job opportunities for a friend who shall remain nameless but who knows who he is.  Just in case.

  UConn still does not allow hiring of foreign based folks as regular employees.  We can look into special payroll/contracting, but the current three open jobs are regular staff positions.


  BTW, here is the link to the jobs info, please forward to anybody who may be interested.
